Exercise 7: Understanding React Context

Description: 

Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using React Context.


Answer:


Benefits:

Avoids Prop Drilling: Allows passing data through the component tree 
without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Global State Management: 
Useful for global settings like themes, locales, or authenticated user data.


Drawbacks:

Performance Issues: Every context consumer will re-render when the 
context value changes, which can lead to performance problems if not 
managed correctly.

Complexity: Can make components less reusable and more 
tightly coupled to the context.
