Exercise 16: Integrating Next.js

Description: 

Briefly explain how to integrate Next.js for server-side rendering.


Answer:

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and 
static site generation. 

It handles routing and offers features like:

Automatic Code Splitting: Optimizes performance by splitting code into 
smaller chunks.

Server-Side Rendering: Renders pages on the server for 
improved SEO and performance.

Static Site Generation: Pre-renders pages at build time.

Integration involves setting up pages in the pages directory and 
using Next.js-specific features like getServerSideProps.
