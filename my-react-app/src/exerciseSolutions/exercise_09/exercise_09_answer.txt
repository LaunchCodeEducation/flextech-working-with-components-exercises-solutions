Exercise 9: Managing Component Lifecycle

Description: 

Explain how useEffect manages the lifecycle of functional components.


Answer:

The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. 

It combines the functionality of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and 
componentWillUnmount in class components. 

The effect runs after the render and can optionally clean up before the 
component unmounts or before re-running the effect.
