Exercise 5: Handling State Changes

Description: 

Explain how state changes in the Counter component cause re-rendering.


Answer:

When the `setCount` function is called (either via the increment or decrement button), 
it updates the 'count' state variable. 

React detects this state change and re-renders the `Counter` component to 
reflect the updated 'count' value. 

This is how React ensures the UI stays in sync with the state.
