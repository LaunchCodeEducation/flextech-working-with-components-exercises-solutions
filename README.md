### Running the Vite Frontend App

Navigate inside of `my-react-app` by using the change directory command:
`cd my-react-app`

Then, you can start the Vite development server by running:
`npm run dev`

This will start the Vite development server. 

You can view this solutions app at http://localhost:3500.

NOTICE THAT FOR THIS SOLUTION REPO, IT WILL RUN ON PORT 3500, NOT PORT 5500.

The project structure should look like this:
`
my-react-app/
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── index.css
├── vite.config.js
└── node_modules/
`

Exercise instructions are in the file named `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt` inside
of the `my-react-app` directory.

Individual exercise solution files are in the folder `exerciseSolutions` inside
of the `my-react-app` directory.
